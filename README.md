# Personal Portfolio

This project is a mashup of various ideas and desires to make my own components rather than use external libraries. This led me to create the background "particles" and picture carousel from scratch, as well as hand crafting the rest of the site. Nothing here is difficult, but coding out my own components gives me a deeper understanding into how they work, rather than using a library like a magic box or learning the mechanics by reading modules. 

### Run
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/whittleguy/portfolio

yarn start      # Alias for the run script configured in `package.json`
```
